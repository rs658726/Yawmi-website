        <p class="mb-2">The policy below applies to all users of the Yawmi application for MacOS/iOS (also
          referred to as "our app"). </p>

        <p class="mb-2">We do not collect, store, or share any personal information related to our users. We do not have access to user data.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">Our app allows you to integrate third party applications into your workflow such as Google or Github. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information related to our users via those third parties. For more information on how your personal information is used by a third party, please refer to the third party's privacy policy and terms of use.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">We do not guarantee the safety of our app's data that is stored in the user's device.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Thus, we encourage you to periodically review this
          page for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
          These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-2">Gmail Integration</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-2">Authentication and Authorization</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">We implemented the Gmail OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate and authorize Gmail-related transactions as defined by <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2">the Google API documentation</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-2">Scopes</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">In order for our user to be able to search, view, edit, or delete their messages, we request the minimum level of access needed which is, in this case, the <i>modify</i> scope, and is defined as follows:</p>
        <p class="mb-2">All read/write operations except immediate, permanent deletion of threads and messages, bypassing Trash.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">For more information about the Gmail API scopes, <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes">click here</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-2">Data Storage</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">We do not store, share, or collect your Gmail messages or your personal information.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">We only store two types of data that are vital to the functioning of Yawmi:</p>
        <ul class="indented-list mb-4" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li class="">Authentication/Authorization tokens are stored in your private Keychain and are needed to log you in automatically when you launch Yawmi. This is all managed by the official Google Sign In SDK for iOS.</li>
          <li>The identification number of any Gmail message you added as a Yawmi task is stored in your private database in order for you to access that message directly from the task detail page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">Yawmi's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">Github Integration</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-2">Authentication and Authorization</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">We implemented the Github OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate and authorize Github-related transactions as defined by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps">the Github API documentation</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-2">Scopes</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">In order for our user to be able to query and view pull requests and issues, we request the type of access known as <i>repo</i> and defined as follows: </p>
        <p class="mb-2"><i>Grants full access to public and private repositories including read and write access to code, commit statuses, repository invitations, collaborators, deployment statuses, and repository webhooks. Note: In addition to repository related resources, the repo scope also grants access to manage organization-owned resources including projects, invitations, team memberships and webhooks. This scope also grants the ability to manage projects owned by users.</i></p>
        <p class="mb-2">Please note that the Github API doesn't offer granular levels of access like other APIs such as Google do, hence the access level discrepancy between what is requested and what is needed.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">For more information about the Github API scopes, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps">click here</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-2">Data Storage</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">We do not store, share, or collect your pull requests, issues, or personal information.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">We only store two types of data that are vital to the functioning of Yawmi:</p>
        <ul class="indented-list mb-6" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li class="">Authentication/Authorization tokens are stored in your private Keychain and are needed to log you in automatically when you launch Yawmi.</li>
